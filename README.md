# Open Jazz

_Learn jazz (theory, improv, etc - piano focused)_

This project is created as a way to record my own jazz learnings alongside creating an open-resource for anyone else who'd like to learn.

Someday I could imagine creating Khan Academy-like lessons for learning music theory, ear training, history lessons (famous tunes, solos, musicians), and more.

Other things I could imagine this resource addressing:

- Practice Techniques
- Bios / Blogs from contemporary musicians, explaining their path / history to become musicians and what it's like for them today
- Connection to other free resources like Coursera courseware
