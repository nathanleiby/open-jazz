### Peri's Scope

"So What" voicings

Hemiola - at measure 13. A hemiola is a repeated rhythmic figure. It creates tension. The drummer sometimes plays it straight and sometimes plays along with it.

Comping - do less. mix down/up beats. Be assertive on the tone shifts (important 2-5's). Try to follow the rhythm in the hemiola.

Soling - breathe. sparse. relax. One approach: "call and response" where you play a chord in LH and then melody in right. On 1 play the chord, and rest of measure play the RH line. Focus on a current goal - try different approaches, but all with same goal (e.g. do less). Again, mark the transitions.

Practice - with a metronome. Ideally, just clicking on 2 and 4. Feel the hi-hat beat.

Listening

	- Eddie Harris (groove)
	- Jazz Crusaders (bop)

Why 3 choruses on blues? (16x3) enough time to say something. not too long.

### Work Song

Soling - play triplets. Anything you want to play, try singing first. Improv isn't really improvised (you practice so much that you are prepared to express yourself)

### Black Nile


Lydian, melodic minor, tonic minor, minor/major chord => C6/9 (#5/#9) 

Thinking of 2-5-1: Cmin #5/#9 goes to F9#11 = B7alt

Dorian mode gets boring, major 7 gives an edge.

The better you get, the more you play the *differences* in chords.

Focus on new/interesting chords. Don't worry about playing all the chords for the boring/regular parts of the harmony.

Soling - listen to more pianists and their apporahc to playing swung 8ths. Understand the bop feel of swung 8ths vs old-style swing. "If you can't sing it you can't play it... it's not in the brain"

## Take-home

- Question: What are "Upper Structures"? (I think these are all the possible chords you can play in the RH over a LH chord. E.g you could play a variety of triads over a given root.)
- Listen: Eddie Harris (groove), Jazz Crusaders (bop), and all songs above
