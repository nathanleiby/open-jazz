## Black Nile

Improv / Soloing - If you're soling on a Med/Fast bop tune, just play slowly (start 1/2 time). Play the tune. Riff of the melody. Use your chops to collect melodic ideas. Someday: "never repeat yourself" aka horizontal approach.

Make the changes. Emphasize the 3s and 7s (guide tones).

2 to 5 or just 5 chord establishes a tonal center. Emphasize where these change.

Listen: Joy Spring, Ceora (shift tonal centers a lot)

Don't worry about shifting the harmonies until you master (or at least follow!) the original shifting harmonies of the song.

Eb7+4 = tritone substitution of A7alt

Consider : 3479 (sus) voicing for D-

Bright = fast

## Nica's Dream

b3 5 M7 9

Harmonies - Try soling with WT scale, diminished scale (HT/WT scale). All melodic minor harmony.

Scale = R b9 #9 3 #11 b13 7 R (Q: which scale?)

HS/WS Scale = R b9 #9 3 #11 5 6 b7 R

Classic Riff - 12345321 (can start on many chords: 2, 5, 1)

Altered Dominant (has #5 = b13). One *trick* to solo over altered = go up 1/2 step and play melodic minor scale. Also HS/WS scale? 

Equivalent (diminished) harmonies:  G7b9 = Bb7b9 = Db7b9 = E7b9  ... useful to learn diminished riffs to solo over these. Dimished licks are pretty universal.

Soloing - Abminor/Major7 = Abmajor with flat 3

harmonic minor sometimes useful in bebop sound.

Hs scale - not so pretty, but breaks up melodic minor sound

## Take-home

- Listen: Joy Spring, Ceora (shift tonal centers a lot), Nica's Dream (listen to counter line in recording)
- Learn Scales: 
	- Whole Tone scale
	- Diminished Scale (= HS/WS scale for dominant chord?)
	- Altered Dominant Scale
	- Melodic Minor modes
	- minors: pure/natural, harmonic (b3), melodic (b3 ... +6+7 on way up, -6-7 on way down).
