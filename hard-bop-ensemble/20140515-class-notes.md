Basic Riffs

- 123(4)5 over chords. Or 12345 321. Note that (4) is ok in minor but less so in major chords.
  - can also lose 4th step or raise 4th step sometimes
- do the minimal amount required to know the chords and "make the changes"
- on b9 or alt dominant - do 12345 from 2nd step of scale (or 3rd?)
  - e.g. for C7+ can start on Eb (F G ...)
- in 2-5 , can do this riff over the 2 or the 5
- LOTS of ways to vary 12345 321
- Ceora and Joyspring have lots of these lines
- 3 is the guide tone. 7 is another guide tone!

Pentatonic

- 6 pentatonic - 1 b3 4 5 6
  - start from b9: b9   3   #11 #5  7
  - start from #9: #9   #11 #5  7   R
- learn scales: 1) bop, 2) be-bop, 3) lydian dominant scales

Goal: want melody and chops.

"shed it" - go off and practice, ie hole up in a shed in the woods

V chords

- alter if you like. esp at end of code, as it's about to resolve.
- advanced: alter chords to creation motion. temporarily change multiple times in a bar (e.g. Coltrane solo in Giant Steps)

Practice

- want to make it stimulating. Also want to show progress from practice.

### Songs

#### "Black Nile"

- Eb7+4 (lydian dominant) vs Eb7+5 (alt)
- ok to play more roots.
- also: can think of Eb7+4 like an A7 (tritone sub)

#### "Along Came Betty"

### Followup

- Listen
  - Clifford Brown
  - Ceora , Joyspring
  - Coltrane solo in "Giant Steps"
  - All the Things you are
