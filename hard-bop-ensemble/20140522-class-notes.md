# Hard Bop

### Songs

#### "Speak Low"

- When playing phrases, try to end with 2 eight notes. think 'be-bop' as the sound of those notes.
- Allow more space in the solo - let others fill the gaps. That's their chance to join in.
- Focus on the difference in the chords. For example: | Gm7 | C7 | ... the difference between these chords is F -> E (7 -> 3)

####  "Along Came Betty"

- listen to Benny Golson's solo
- lots of chromaticism in the song. emphasize it.
- tips: play each chord in the song with a huge variety of simple riffs over it
  1. arpeggios
  2. 123
  3. 321
  4. 12345
  5. 12345 321
  6. 5(54)321
  7. 67 5321
  8. 7 543 [triplet] 21
  9. 9 765 321
- Be able to execute these riffs over any chord/key
- "Anything you can do over a minor chord, you can also do over a dominant. It will sound like a sus"

#### "Peri's Scope"

- @60min - Can solo using major chord. Also can solo with WT scale (from C to C).
- emphasize dominant chords
- song is very diatonic. start with mastering that, then do new things.
- melody has lots of 3's and 7's (in this and so many tunes). A few 4's and #11 to mix it up!

#### "Nica's Dream"

- Work on swinging the middle park
- When playing lots of quarter note, try to play long/short/long/short. This causes you to start swinging

#### Black Nile

- @94:00 has some ideas
- can emphasize the roots more
- there are few changes, so really emphasize them
- Can play Melodic scale over Dm, and Melodic scale (though lydian, with +4) over Eb7+4
