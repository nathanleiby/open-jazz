# Lesson - June 19, 2014

## Post performance debrief

- Listen to comping (1) rhythm, then (2) voicing. In some songs, the comping is so distinct that it can be considered part of the tune/head
- Practice INs and OUTs. Prep these for solos. 
  - The same philosophy applies for any practice -- really nail the transitions.
  - Work from a place of safety, known. Lets you get started and be more relaxed.
- Solo ideas:
  - Continue the sound/voice of the person who played before (or contrast completely)
    - To practice, find a buddy and trade 4s a lot
  - Quote solo at start, but with embellishments
    - Helps listeners who dont care for unusual soloing as much
    - Prevents the need to come up with a totally new melody on the spot

## So What Voicings

- Stacked 4ths and a Major 3rd on top. (4th, 4th, 4th, 3rd)
- Can be diatonic or parallel
- McCoy Tyner famous for 4ths

Diatonic     | Parallel 

I:   4 4 4 M3  | 
II:  4 4 4 M3  | 
III: tritone 4 4 m3 | 4 (Bb) 4 4 M3
IV: 4 4 tritone m3 | 4 4 4 (Bb) M3
V: 4 4 4 M3 | 
VI: 4 4 4 m3 | 
VII: 4 tritone 4 m3 | 4 4 4 (Bb) M3

So I, II, and V are the same in diatonic and parallel voicings. But others differ.

Lots of drills to practice ... mix and match these varations:

- Play scale up (8 beats), down (8 beats, so repeat top note), or both.
- Scale-like, but instead play... 1-2-3,2-3-4,3-4-5, ... (up or down) .... this is a more realistic comping pattern
- diatonic and parallel
- Play in all keys

The top not of these chords is a 5. If its a minor chord in a song, then can usually use a "So What" voicing. GOAL: Find >=1 in other tunes and apply.

"So What Solo"

- Analyze it.
- Pure rhythmic displacement (move all the notes, maintain exact timing) vs 'non-pure' change time value of >= 1 note.

Comping and Soloing over 4ths

- Over these voicings, there is more floatiness in the sound and your solo can break free more.
- Experiment with tension release of these chords and the solo.

TODOS:

- Find minor chords in another tune to apply So What voicing
- Analyze So What Solo
- Play Diatonic and Parallel So What exercises
- Practice Soloing techniques, try/record a few and see how I feel. Get feedback @ next lesson.
- Listen to McCoy Tyner and try to find So What voicings or other 4th oriented voicings
